## Ange Postecoglou's Feedback to Pedro Porro

After Tottenham's Europa League draw with Rangers, manager Ange Postecoglou provided constructive feedback to right-back Pedro Porro. The incident in question occurred late in the game when Porro volleyed the ball back to goalkeeper Fraser Forster under pressure, forcing Forster into a difficult situation.

> "He’s played a volley back to Fraser in the 92nd minute of the game. Fraser was unbelievable last night, and you are putting a teammate under pressure. It’s about the context of what we are doing right now," said Postecoglou.

Postecoglou emphasized the importance of making better decisions in key moments, especially in tight games. He highlighted that small mistakes, like the pass back to the goalkeeper, could jeopardize all the hard work done to get back into the match.

> "We have got to make better decisions, we have to be really calm and clear-headed. We had done so well to get back into a difficult tie. We were in a good position – why put that in jeopardy? That’s my role, to give the players feedback."

## Fighting Mentality in the Squad

When asked if he had enough "fighters" in his squad, Postecoglou acknowledged that his team had shown resilience during the match. He stated that the team still displayed elements of mental strength, despite injuries affecting squad availability.

> "All we've got is who is available, that's the reality of how it is, and yes. We still had elements of that even last night," he said.

> "Anybody who was at the stadium could see 'this is going to be hard'. There was a moment where you go 'have we got it in us to get something out of this game?' and we did."

Postecoglou stressed that being a "fighter" is not about tackling hard but about having belief, conviction, and consistency. He encouraged players to play with determination regardless of how they feel.

> "It's about playing our football and having belief and conviction. It's not about whether you are feeling well or feeling confident. There's no time for that right now."

## Handling Player Expectations

Postecoglou was asked if it was frustrating to remind experienced players about their responsibilities in difficult moments. The manager acknowledged that the squad is dealing with extraordinary circumstances due to injuries and the demands of European competition.

> "It is an extraordinary situation we are in. Where we are squad-wise with the injuries we have and what we ask our players to do, these are extraordinary circumstances."

However, Postecoglou viewed his guidance as a reminder rather than a criticism of the players' understanding of the game.

> "It's more of a reminder to the players. It's not that I don't believe that they don’t understand."

This insight provides a glimpse into how Postecoglou is navigating a challenging period for Tottenham, emphasizing mental clarity, decision-making, and resilience as key traits he wants to see from his players.
