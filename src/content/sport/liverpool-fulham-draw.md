# Diogo Jota's Comeback Goal Rescues 10-Man Liverpool Against Fulham

Liverpool's clash with Fulham at Anfield was a rollercoaster ride filled with goals, drama, and a controversial red card. Diogo Jota's late equalizer saved a point for the 10-man Reds, who had to battle from behind twice after Andrew Robertson was sent off early in the first half.

## **How the Match Unfolded**

Fulham stunned Liverpool early, taking the lead in the 11th minute. Andreas Pereira displayed outstanding technique to volley home Antonee Robinson's cross, with a deflection off Robertson aiding the goal. Things quickly went from bad to worse for Liverpool as Robertson was sent off just six minutes later after a VAR review confirmed his foul on Harry Wilson denied a clear goalscoring opportunity.

Liverpool, however, showed their resilience after the break. Within two minutes of the restart, Cody Gakpo met Mohamed Salah's pinpoint cross at the far post to level the score. But Fulham wasnâ€™t done. Rodrigo Muniz capitalized on a defensive lapse to put the Cottagers ahead once again in the 76th minute.

It seemed like it might be another frustrating day for the Reds, but substitute Diogo Jota had other plans. Just six minutes after coming off the bench, he controlled Darwin Nunezâ€™s pass and calmly slotted home to level the match. Both teams had chances to win it late on, but neither could find the decisive goal.

## **Robertsonâ€™s Red Card Shakes Liverpoolâ€™s Stability**

Andrew Robertsonâ€™s red card was a turning point in the match. After a tough challenge from Issa Diop in the opening minute, his afternoon went from bad to worse. His involvement in Pereiraâ€™s opener was unlucky, but his tackle on Wilson was reckless. VAR left referee Michael Oliver with no choice but to show a straight red card, leaving Liverpool with a steep uphill battle.

Despite the setback, Arne Slotâ€™s side showcased their determination. Salahâ€™s 100th assist in a Liverpool shirt set up Gakpoâ€™s equalizer, and Jotaâ€™s composure under pressure salvaged the draw. Virgil van Dijkâ€™s late effort was blocked as Liverpool pushed hard for a winner, but it was not to be.

## **Fulhamâ€™s Grit and Determination**

Fulhamâ€™s performance was a testament to their growth this season. Theyâ€™ve already held Manchester City and Arsenal to tough encounters, and this was no different. Marco Silvaâ€™s side arrived at Anfield with belief and left with a well-earned point.

Their opener was a moment of magic from Pereira, whose acrobatic finish showed his class. Fulhamâ€™s defensive organization frustrated Liverpool throughout, and Munizâ€™s clinical finish looked like it might be enough to secure a famous win. Even after Jotaâ€™s equalizer, Fulhamâ€™s belief never wavered, with Adama Traoreâ€™s late strike forcing Alisson into a crucial save.

## **Ryanâ€™s Verdict**

This match had everything â€” goals, drama, and passion. Liverpoolâ€™s ability to fight back with 10 men shows their mental strength under Arne Slot, but the defensive lapses are a concern. Andrew Robertsonâ€™s red card was avoidable, and itâ€™s these moments that can define tight Premier League title races.

On the flip side, Fulhamâ€™s grit was impressive. Marco Silva has built a side thatâ€™s tough to beat, even at the toughest venues like Anfield. Their attacking flair, defensive structure, and ability to stay calm under pressure make them a team to watch this season.

In the end, a 2-2 draw was a fair result, but Liverpool will feel like it was two points dropped. With Chelsea chasing them at the top of the table, every point counts. Up next for Liverpool is a clash with Tottenham, and theyâ€™ll need to be at their best â€” and keep all 11 players on the pitch.
