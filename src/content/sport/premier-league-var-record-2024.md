# Which Premier League Team Has the Best VAR Record in 2024?

VAR (Video Assistant Referee) continues to be one of the most debated aspects of modern football. Since its introduction, it has influenced key match decisions, from disallowed goals to controversial penalty calls. In 2024, the role of VAR has been as pivotal as ever, with certain teams benefiting more than others. So, which Premier League team has had the best VAR record this season?

<br>

## 1. **How VAR Decisions Are Counted**

To determine which Premier League team has the best VAR record, we consider two key factors:

- **VAR Decisions in Favor:** The number of decisions (goals allowed, penalties awarded, red cards overturned) that went in favor of a team.
- **VAR Decisions Against:** The number of decisions that worked against a team (disallowed goals, penalties given to opponents, red cards upheld).

The difference between "VAR For" and "VAR Against" is often referred to as a team's **VAR Net Score**, a key indicator of which teams benefit the most.

With each decision affecting the league table, fans, managers, and players alike remain divided on its effectiveness. Only time will tell if future changes make it a more reliable and fair system for all.
