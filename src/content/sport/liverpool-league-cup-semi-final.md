**Liverpool Reach League Cup Semi-Finals with a 2-1 Win Over Southampton**

Liverpool have advanced to the League Cup semi-finals after defeating managerless Southampton 2-1 at St Mary's Stadium. Goals from Darwin Nunez and Harvey Elliott propelled the Reds into the final four for a record 20th time.

The win comes after a surprise 2-2 draw against Fulham in the Premier League, but under manager Arne Slot, Liverpool are back on track with 20 wins from 24 matches across all competitions. Slot, who replaced Jurgen Klopp, has now guided Liverpool to just one loss during his tenure.

**Arne Slot's Tactical Decisions Pay Off**

With a touchline suspension keeping him in the stands, Arne Slot made a bold decision to rest key players Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk, opting for eight changes in the starting XI. Despite the changes, Liverpool's squad depth proved too strong for Southampton.

**Darwin Nunez and Harvey Elliott Shine**

Darwin Nunez ended a six-game goal drought with a clinical finish in the 24th minute, capitalizing on a defensive miscue by Jan Bednarek after a pinpoint pass from Trent Alexander-Arnold. This marked Nunez's fourth goal of the season, giving Liverpool the edge.

Eight minutes later, Harvey Elliott doubled Liverpool's lead with a precise low drive past Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy. This was Elliott's first goal of the season, further boosting Liverpool's confidence heading into the second half.

**Southampton’s Late Response Falls Short**

Southampton’s Cameron Archer provided a glimmer of hope for the home side with a superb curling strike in the 59th minute. The home crowd called for a penalty after Jarell Quansah's challenge on Mateus Fernandes, but the referee saw no reason to intervene, leaving Southampton frustrated.

The defeat was a disappointing start for caretaker manager Simon Rusk, who took charge after Russell Martin's dismissal following a 5-0 loss to Tottenham.

**Newcastle Advance Alongside Liverpool**

Meanwhile, Newcastle United also secured their place in the League Cup semi-finals with a commanding 3-1 win over Brentford. Italian midfielder Sandro Tonali scored twice, while Fabian Schar added a third to put the Magpies in a strong position for a potential trophy chase.

**What’s Next?**

Liverpool's League Cup journey continues as they prepare for the semi-final stage. With the possibility of facing strong opposition like Newcastle, Tottenham, or Manchester United, Liverpool will look to maintain their impressive form under Arne Slot.

Stay tuned for more updates on Liverpool’s quest for League Cup glory and the latest news on football’s biggest stories.
