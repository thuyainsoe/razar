## LaLiga to Report Vinícius Júnior's Gesture and Fan Chants

LaLiga will formally report a gesture made by Real Madrid star **Vinícius Júnior** at Rayo Vallecano fans, as well as the chants directed at him, following Madrid's 3-3 draw on Saturday, sources have told ESPN.

The Brazil international came on as a second-half substitute during the thrilling clash in Vallecas. Real Madrid initially went 2-0 down, fought back to lead 3-2, but conceded late to drop two vital points in the title race.

## Controversial Gesture

Video clips circulated on social media showing **Vinícius Júnior** responding to chants from the home crowd with a gesture that appeared to suggest **Rayo Vallecano** would be relegated to the second division.

On Monday, sources confirmed that **LaLiga** would report both the fan behavior and **Vinícius' response** to the Spanish football federation's disciplinary committee.

## Reactions to the Incident

LaLiga president **Javier Tebas** addressed the situation, saying:

> "I think there was provocation, with those insults, and the player, like any other, got annoyed, that's all."

However, Tebas clarified that there were no racist chants involved.

## Rayo Vallecano President Speaks Out

Speaking to COPE radio on Sunday, **Rayo president Raúl Martín Presa** criticized Vinícius' actions, stating:

> "You're telling a fan, a Rayo fan, 'go to the second division' when for us, being in the first division is survival. Footballers should be professional."

The incident has reignited debates about player conduct and fan behavior in Spanish football, as **Real Madrid** continue their title pursuit.
