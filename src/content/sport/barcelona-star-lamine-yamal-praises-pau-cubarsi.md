Barcelona rising star Pau Cubarsí has earned high praise from his teammate and close friend Lamine Yamal. The young centre-back has been one of the breakout talents of the new season, showcasing immense potential and consistency in his performances.

Under the guidance of Barcelona's new head coach, Hansi Flick, the 17-year-old Cubarsí has become a key figure in the starting lineup, already making 22 appearances across all competitions. His ability to excel on both defensive and offensive fronts has not gone unnoticed.

One of his most vocal supporters is Lamine Yamal, a fellow Barcelona prodigy and the latest recipient of Tuttosport’s prestigious 'Golden Boy' award, which recognizes the best young player in the world. Speaking on Monday, Yamal did not hold back in his assessment of Cubarsí’s abilities.

" Pau Cubarsí is already one of the top-5 best centre backs in the world. Mark my words, Cubarsí can be the next one to win the Golden Boy, in 2025. His level every day is just unbelievable," Yamal declared.

Such high praise from one of football's most promising young stars highlights the immense potential that Cubarsí holds. With consistent performances, he could indeed be in contention for future accolades, including the coveted Golden Boy award.

As Barcelona continues its pursuit of domestic and European glory, all eyes will be on Pau Cubarsí to see if he can maintain his rapid rise to stardom and prove himself as one of the best defenders in the world.
